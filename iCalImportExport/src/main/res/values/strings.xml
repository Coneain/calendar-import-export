    <string name="changelog">Version 1.6:\nNew forked version\nMany fixes for Android >= 4.0\nNew design
        \n\nVersion 1.5:\nBasic Http authentication and Ftp authentication via
        input fields. Small bugfix regarding dummy calendar. Insert manual
        alarm, no VAlarm support.
        \n\nVersion 1.4:\nReleased under GPL v3, source available under:
        http://code.google.com/p/ical-import-export/
        \nA life without google:
        If you have no calendars installed, a local calendar can be created.
        But there has to be an existing account (yahoo, or something else)
        \n\nVersion 1.3:\nSaves the last URL
        \n\nVersion 1.2:\nTimezone of an event will be changed according to your local
        android timezone. I am not sure if that works, timezones are very
        confusing.
        \n\nVersion 1.1:\nAssociate program with iCal files. Working in web browser. In
        Froyo also working with any type of file browser.
        \n\nVersion 1.0:\nSupporting simple iCal import and export. Attendees are not
        supported.</string>
